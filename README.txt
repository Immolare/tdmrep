TDMRep integrates the TDM Reservation Protocol on WordPress to facilitate access to text and data mining rights for online content.

== Description ==

TDMRep is a WordPress plugin that integrates the [TDM Reservation Protocol](https://www.w3.org/community/reports/tdmrep/CG-FINAL-tdmrep-20240202/), a simple and practical web protocol for expressing the reservation of rights related to text and data mining of lawfully accessible web content. TDM (Text and Data Mining) refers to the process of extracting valuable information from large sets of text and data.

The TDM Reservation Protocol helps to streamline the communication of TDM rights and licenses available for online copyrighted content, making it easier for publishers to express their TDM rights reservation and licensing policies in a standardized and machine-readable format.

### What is Text and Data Mining (TDM)?

Text and data mining (TDM) is the process of automatically extracting information from large sets of text and data using software tools and techniques. TDM is used in a wide range of fields, including academic research, business intelligence, and data journalism, to discover new insights and knowledge.

### Why Use TDM Reservation Protocol?

The TDM Reservation Protocol is a technical solution to the constraints set by [Article 4 of the new European Directive on copyright and related rights in the Digital Single Market](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019L0790&from=EN). It provides a clear and unambiguous way for publishers to express their TDM rights and licensing policies, making it easier for TDM agents to discover and comply with those policies. This helps to reduce legal uncertainty and facilitate the development of TDM applications.

In summary, TDMRep is a powerful and easy-to-use plugin that helps publishers and TDM agents communicate TDM rights and licenses in a standardized and machine-readable format. It supports the TDM Reservation Protocol, which is essential for anyone involved in text and data mining of online copyrighted content.

### TDM Reservation Protocol Techniques

TDMRep integrates 3 of the 4 complementary techniques offered by the TDM Reservation Protocol:

#### TDM File on the Origin Server (.well-known/tdmrep.json): files, images, pages, posts, sets of urls

The TDM File on the Origin Server technique allows publishers to declare site-wide rights holders' choices in a machine-readable file hosted on the web server. TDMRep generates this file and provides an interface for publishers to manage their TDM reservation and licensing policies.

#### TDM Header Field in HTTP Responses (.htaccess): files, images, pages, posts, sets of urls

The TDM Header Field in HTTP Responses technique allows publishers to declare their TDM rights reservation and licensing policies in the HTTP header of the response to a GET or HEAD request. TDMRep integrates this technique by adding the necessary header fields to the HTTP responses generated by WordPress.

#### TDM Metatags in page, posts or set of urls

TDMRep also supports the use of meta tags to express TDM rights and licensing policies on individual pages and posts, providing a more granular level of control for publishers who want to specify different policies for different parts of their website.

## Expressing a TDM Policy

TDMRep plugin allows publishers to express their TDM policies in a machine-readable format using the TDM Policy feature. This feature provides a way for TDM actors to contact content rightsholders and offers details about available TDM licenses, facilitating the acquisition of TDM licenses from rightsholders by TDM actors.

The TDM Policy feature is integrated into the TDMRep plugin and includes the following:

- Assigner
- Permissions

With this feature, publishers can easily express their TDM policies, including the type of permission granted, any constraints on the type of usage, and any duties required of the TDM actor, such as the duty to contact the rightsholder before getting permission or the duty to compensate financially the rightsholder.
